I was a teaching assistant, helping students debug their code, clarifying newly learned concepts, and providing personal tips on approaching a problem. I was a treasurer for an organization and was part of a committee that hosted a leadership conference for my school. In the past two summers, I experienced two internships, gaining real-world experience from applying my education to contribute to their projects and goals. \n\n# Currently\n\nI am seeking an opportunity to further my development after graduation by going full-time into software engineering or IT role. I am eager to continue learning and also working alongside like-minded individuals from a company that offers greater challenges and innovation. \n\n\n# Some history\n\n- My parents bought our first family computer when I was 7. I couldn't remember the exact model but it was very similar to HP Pavilion DV6646. That laptop lasted for 1-2 years before it eventually died. Maybe from virus from something we downloaded. At the time, we only have ADSL internet with very slow speeds (2Mbps download, 1 Mbps upload). \n\n- I was 12 when I underwent an eye surgery for strabismus. I was in China during the time and stayed at an eye hospital. \n\n- I was 13 when I got my first ever smartphone. Originally, I wanted iPhone 4S but ended up getting Samsung Galaxy S III due to open nature of Android.\n\n- When I was 14, I built my first ever PC. Actually 2 PCs. One was an AMD build and the other was Intel. My dream at the time was to become a content creator. One would be a gaming PC with the other as a streaming PC. Unfortunately, I did not commit to my dream.\n\n- At 15, I finally got my driver's license. I've always wanted to drive but now I can legally. \n\n- At 18, I finally switched to an iPhone X. Yay iMessage!\n\n- 13 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Grand Theft Auto V and Call of Duty.\n\n- At 18, I started college and made interesting decisions as a freshman. Classes, Jobs, Friends, etc. \n\n- At 22, I finally launched this website. Yes, it took a while. Thanks for waiting. \n\n# I like\n\n- Researching\n- Biking\n- Watching YouTube videos\n- Following influencers\n- Reading about tech\n- Music\n- Video Games\n- Shopping\n- Driving\n- Eating\n- Photography\n- Exploring cities\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I was originally from Chicago, Illinois. I have since lived in Demotte, Indiana and then more recently moved to Crown Point, Indiana.\n- I've been to only 2 other countries, but my wish to travel around the world has been suppressed by COVID-19 pandemic.\n- In 2000-2002, I visited: China. Yes, when I was still an infant and toddler. \n- In 2005, I revisited China. (Winter Break... I was in kindergarten.)\n- In 2011, I revisited China. (I was in 5th grade.)\n- In 2012, I revisited China. (I was in 6th grade.)\n- In 2017, I visited Toronto, Canada as part of a 2 day Niagara Falls & Canada trip during Independence Day.\n- From 2017 to 2021, I went to New York City every summer, with the exception of 2020 due to COVID-19. \n- In 2018, I went to Pennsylvania for Whitewater Rafting! \n- In 2021, I visited New York City also for Christmas.\n- In 2022, I hope to start traveling again.\n- Chicago trips are undocumented since I've been there bazillion times. \n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I carry around two phones: iPhone 13 Pro Max & Pixel 4a. \n- I am very good with navigation and maps. I can memorize the roads and know how to get to places again.\n- I prefer to use sticky notes over a calendar.\n- I have a YouTube channel with 5k subscribers and made $1.5k from ad revenue. No, you won't be able to find it. Don't even try.\n- I self-taught myself Chinese (Mandarin) since my family only speaks dialect.\n- I own too many technology. Not ashamed but ashamed.\n- I love driving, but slowly getting bored of driving. Next dream car is Tesla Model Y.  \n\n# I dream of\n\n- looking for inspiration.\n- learning something new each day.\n- staying positive.\n- becoming better.",c=l.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,h=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(t.jsx)(o.b,Object(i.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(t.jsx)(d.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Jacky Zheng",children:Object(t.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(t.jsx)("header",{children:Object(t.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(t.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(t.jsx)(o.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(t.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",c," words)"]})]})}),Object(t.jsx)(s.a,{source:l,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
