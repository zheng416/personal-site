# Intro

I am currently a senior, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science while also minoring in Economics at Purdue University. I was a teaching assistant, helping students debug their code, clarifying newly learned concepts, and providing personal tips on approaching a problem. I was a treasurer for an organization and was part of a committee that hosted a leadership conference for my school. In the past two summers, I experienced two internships, gaining real-world experience from applying my education to contribute to their projects and goals. 

# Currently

I am seeking an opportunity to further my development after graduation by going full-time into software engineering or IT role. I am eager to continue learning and also working alongside like-minded individuals from a company that offers greater challenges and innovation. 


# Some history

- My parents bought our first family computer when I was 7. I couldn't remember the exact model but it was very similar to HP Pavilion DV6646. That laptop lasted for 1-2 years before it eventually died. Maybe from virus from something we downloaded. At the time, we only have ADSL internet with very slow speeds (2Mbps download, 1 Mbps upload). 

- I was 12 when I underwent an eye surgery for strabismus. I was in China during the time and stayed at an eye hospital. 

- I was 13 when I got my first ever smartphone. Originally, I wanted iPhone 4S but ended up getting Samsung Galaxy S III due to open nature of Android.

- When I was 14, I built my first ever PC. Actually 2 PCs. One was an AMD build and the other was Intel. My dream at the time was to become a content creator. One would be a gaming PC with the other as a streaming PC. Unfortunately, I did not commit to my dream.

- At 15, I finally got my driver's license. I've always wanted to drive but now I can legally. 

- At 18, I finally switched to an iPhone X. Yay iMessage!

- 13 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Grand Theft Auto V and Call of Duty.

- At 18, I started college and made interesting decisions as a freshman. Classes, Jobs, Friends, etc. 

- At 22, I finally launched this website. Yes, it took a while. Thanks for waiting.

- In 2012, I revisited China. (I was in 6th grade.)
- In 2017, I visited Toronto, Canada as part of a 2 day Niagara Falls & Canada trip during Independence Day.
- From 2017 to 2021, I went to New York City every summer, with the exception of 2020 due to COVID-19. 
- In 2018, I went to Pennsylvania for Whitewater Rafting!

# Fun facts
